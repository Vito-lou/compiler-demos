## compiler-demos

This repo collects my practices about compiler

- logicflow-to-js
  This repo is about how to generate js code from logicflow json data.
  In real project, we would normally drag and drop the logic nodes on the canvas, and we may call it logic editor. When we need to execute it, compiling the json to the js source code and inject it into the project maybe a good choice.
  Therefore, this repo can demonstrate how to make it work.
